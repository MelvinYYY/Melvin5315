      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>According to Microsoft, “Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises”. This computer program performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. It allows the developer to remotely create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

      Though NGINX became famous as the fastest web server, the scalable underlying architecture has proved ideal for many web tasks beyond serving content. Because it can handle a high volume of connections, NGINX is commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage incoming traffic and distribute it to slower upstream servers – anything from legacy database servers to microservices.
